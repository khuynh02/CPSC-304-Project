## PNE 2 - An Amusement Park Management Tool

The system is designed to act as an amusement park management tool, where a user (manager) can manage the staff, events, rides, and customers by interacting with a relational database. The project demonstrates the ability to integrate Java with an Oracle database, providing a user-friendly interface for database interactions in an enterprise-level application.

The application serves as a practical exercise in working with Java and relational databases, focusing on key aspects such as SQL queries, database connection handling, and the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
